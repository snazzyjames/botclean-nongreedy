This is a solution to the BotClean problem on HackerRank.  I wrote it out without looking up any algorithms that have been developed, just to see if I could figure out a good way for the robot to find the closest dirty cell next to him and travel to it.

This solution scored a 17.75 out of possible 17.82.  The implementation that scores a perfect score using the greedy algorithm is in another repository.
